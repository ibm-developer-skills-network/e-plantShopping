## Introduction
This repository was created as part of IBM's "Developing Front End Apps with React" course.<br>
A React application was created as a final project: Paradise Nursery Shopping Cart App.<br>
<br>
With this application, users can select plants in an online plant shop and add them to the shopping cart.<br>
<br>
Home screen:<br>

The user receives feedback when making a selection, which improves the user experience.<br>
See, for example, the grayed-out button on selection or the number of products in the shopping cart at the top right.

Once the selection has been made, he can display the contents by clicking on the shopping cart.<br>
If necessary, the quantity can be increased or decreased.<br>

If the user still has requests and would like to display the product list, they can click on the “Continue Shopping” button.<br>

The implementation of the checkout button was not part of the project.<br>
To inform the user of this, an alert is displayed when the button is clicked:<br>
